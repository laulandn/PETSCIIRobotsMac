The ongoing result of a challenge on MacintoshGarden:

"So let's talk about the elephant in the room. Attack of the PETSCII Robots. I can play it on my Mac - but only by using the Apple II card in my LCIII. Not the best experience possible. And PETSCII Robots has been ported to many different systems - including ones with a 68000CPU (Amiga), and ones with a black and white only screen (or, at least, black and white for the purposes of in-game graphics). The Mac is ripe for a conversion - and, given the specifications of the Mac vs those of the other computers that it's been ported to, a Mac colour version would be the most spectacular version of the game bar none."
